# CCDA to Graph Model Conversion Pipeline
#

# The first step is the ingestion of the XML file using the CCDA
# schemas.  This will produce a graph that looks like the CCDA structure

- operation: ingest/xml
  params:
    bundle:

#- operation: writeGraph

# Next step is to convert that CCDA graph into the common graph model.
# The graph model is Person centric.
